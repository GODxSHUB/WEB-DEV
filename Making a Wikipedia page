        India, officially the Republic of India,[j][21] 
        is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest 
        country by area; the most populous country from June 2023 
        onwards;[22][23] and since its independence in 1947, the world's 
        most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the
         Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the 
         southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, 
         it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k]
          China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh
           and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, 
           India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its 
           Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime 
           border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.
